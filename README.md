# Hello-World

Greetings and Salutations!

ITRW, I answer to Michael, Hey you!, or just about anything that sounds reasonably friendly.  I can be best destribed as a cranky
old fart, who has nothing better to do these days than sit in front of a computer terminal doing GORKW (God Only, Really Knows
What). My interests are as varied as the stars in the universe, but herein, I'll restrain myself to those endeavors that are
relevant to this realm.

Prior to becoming totally and perminently disabled, I spent my time driving tankers around the country delivering hazardous and
non-hazardous chemicals to various industrial and agricultural customers.  Before that, I spent my time sitting in front of a
computer terminal doing GORKW; repairing and refurbishing electronic and electrical gadgets of all kinds and types; and, reading
books about doing GORKW on a computer and with the electronic and electrical gadgets that I found myself surrouded by.

Finally, while I do consider myself relatively knowdegable on a wide range of subjects, I know I am no where near as smart as some
would claim me to be.  Nor am I as knowledgable as I would like to be.  That being said, I am always open to suggestions and new
ideas from others.  Nor do I have any problem asking for help when I get stumped by something.  Admittedly those times are
relatively few and far between, they do occur.  On the flip side of that coin, unless I am asked for my input, I tend to keep my
mouth shut.  Sorry, but that is something that carries over from raising five very intelligent and independent children.
